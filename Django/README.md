# Django Application
A web application for Fun-emes language learning project.

## Main Directories and Functions
django_env - python virutal environment for package organization
django_project - main project folder

The project is made from tutorial so the frontend functionalities do not exactly match what we will have later on. Layouts of pages are temporary.

## Environment Setup and Installations
Runs on latest version of python (python3) and need pip to install needed packages so make sure that you have them on your machine

`cd Django/django_project` \
`source env/bin/activate` to start the virtual environment, make sure to do this before running the server

Necessary packages and libraries to install before running server for the first time if you do not already have them:
`pip install django`\
`pip install SpeechRecognition`\
`brew install portaudio`\
`pip install pyaudio`\

Then inside Django/django_project folder, run \
`python manage.py runserver`\

After development server started with no errors, open a browser and use address `localhost:8000/blog` to go to the main page
This route will also be changed later


Other routes to note are: \
`localhost:8000/blog/audio` - speech recognition page, press Record to start recording your audio and the red text on the screen will update \
`localhost:8000/blog/about`- temporary page that has no function, will modify later \
